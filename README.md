SQURL - Implemented for Useless utility competition, The Gathering, TG, 2021.

SQURL is a web app that allows you to get to know the different squirrels that are located in central park, NYC. 
In this app the squirrels are represented on a interactive map, and when pressing a squirrel marker, you are presenter cozy facts about that specific squirrel. Colorful images represent the squirrels qualities and actions.

For the best experience, you should take a look at a number of squirrels, not just a single one!

## Getting Started
The app is written in Python with Dash framework.
The app is also available on https://squrl.herokuapp.com/.
If you wish to run it locally you must follow the steps below. 

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.X  (I used 3.7.10) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/)

To check if you have python and pip installed you can write 'python -h' and 'pip -h' in the console. If you get info on how to use the program, you are good to go. 


### Setup
Start by opening your preferred terminal, and navigate to this project's directory.
To be able to run the code, you need to install the required python modules.
You install the required libraries by writing the following in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running the code
```
python app.py
```

The Dash app should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/, and you must open up that address in a browser of your choice.




If you have problems running the app in the console and are using windows, make sure that the Windows PATH for python/python script is okay. Here is a guide: https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/
